A non-fungible is created by adding restrictions to fungible mints \u2013 i.e., for a mint to be considered \\"non-fungible\\", it must have supply 1, decimals 0 and no mint authority. As a consequence, NFT standards carry \\"baggage\\" from the requirements of fungibles to represent non-fungibles. For example, non-fungibles have a supply of 1 by definition, but you still need a separate mint and token accounts.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"bridge/features":{"id":"bridge/features","title":"Features","description":"Coming soon.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"bridge/overview":{"id":"bridge/overview","title":"Overview","description":"Coming soon.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"clients/JavaScript":{"id":"clients/JavaScript","title":"JavaScript Client","description":"Coming soon.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"clients/Rust":{"id":"clients/Rust","title":"Rust Client","description":"Coming soon.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"quickstart":{"id":"quickstart","title":"Quickstart","description":"CLI","sidebar":"docsSidebar"}}}')}}]);
