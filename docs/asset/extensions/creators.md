# Creators

The `Creators` extension allows adding a list of creators to an asset, specifying their status (`verified` or not) and a percentage share. In most cases, this extension is used in combination with `Royalties` to determine the addresses that should received royalties. There is no limit on how many creators can be added to an asset.
